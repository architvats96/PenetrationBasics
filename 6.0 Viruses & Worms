The main difference between a trojan and a worm is that the trojan needs human interaction for initliazation while worm can work 
without one.

The various tools used in this module are bintext, delme, Internet Worm Maker Thing and JPS Video Maker.

Bintext: This is a windows tool and is used to extract information from a .EXE file which basically gives an idea about how a
  software works.

Delme Batch Virus Generator: This is a windows tool to make a virus using just point and click. This generates the code for the
  things you click. The thing to be noted here is that if you look at the code generated by the program you will find that the
  program leaves breadcrumbs everywhere. Easy to use program anyway.

Internet Worm Maker Thing: Same as Delme

JPS Video Maker: Same as Delme
