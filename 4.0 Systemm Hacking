This is where the fun part begins. It includes ADS, LCP (Link Control Protocol), pwdump and sethc.

ADS: Alternate Data Streams are used only in NTFS systems and are used to fork data to a file without changing its size or functionality.
  These files will be hidden and wonâ€™t be shown in a dir terminal command. These files can be made like this on command prompt :-
  notepad.exe Visible.txt:Hidden.txt
  If the main file is deleted in future the ADS associated with it will drop itself. These data streams can be detected with some softwares such as ADS Spy.

LCP: This is used to bruteforce the passwords of user accounts of any platform and can be downloaded from lcpsoft.com

PWDUMP: This tool is used to dump the sam file on to the command prompt. The identifier 500 states that its the adminstrator account
  and the identifier 501 states that its the guest account. This gives us the usernames and whether they are password protected or not.
  SYNTAX $pwdump <hostname>

SETHC.exe: This is actually a windows file that sits in C:\Windows\System32 and is activated as sticky keys. By changing any filename
  to sethc.exe and copying it in C:\Windows\System32 I would be able to run it by simply pressing the sticky keys. This can even be used
  while logging into the system without password.

TELNET: This is a protocol used to get shell account of a system.

Snow: This is a steganography tool on windows just as gpg on linux.
