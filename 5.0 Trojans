In this module we use softwares such as fport, icmpsrv & icmpsend, md5deep, netstat

Fport: This is a windows program which reports all the running processes along with there process id, name, port and address
  of execution.

Icmpsrv & Icmpsend: These trojans are used to create a remote connection to a connected computer for shell commands and process.
  How we use it is that we run icmpsrv on the target computer and icmpsrv on the host computer. Rest of the stuff will be self
  explanatory once these steps are performed.

MD5deep: This tool is used to calculate md5 hash of any file.

Netstat: Print network connections, routing tables and interface statistics.
