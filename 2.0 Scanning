This includes port scanning, vulnerability scanning, os fingerprinting. The tools used are nmap, hping3, dnsenum and nikto.

DNSENUM: This tool gives a well expressed information about a hostâ€™s address, mail address, mail servers and zone transfers

  It can be installed with this
  apt-get update && \
  apt-get install -y git && \
  apt-get install -y build-essential && \
  apt-get install -y cpanminus && \
  git clone https://github.com/fwaeytens/dnsenum.git /home/dnsenum/ && \
  chmod +x /home/dnsenum/dnsenum.pl && \
  ln -s /home/dnsenum/dnsenum.pl /usr/bin/dnsenum && \
  cpanm String::Random && \
  cpanm Net::IP && \
  cpanm Net::DNS && \
  cpanm Net::Netmask && \
  cpanm XML::Writer

NMAP: This is a very handy tool to find open ports, os fingerprints and various other stuff about a server. It include various 
  kinds of techniques such as full open scan, half open scan, xmas scan, fin scan, null/zombie scan, idle scan, icmpecho scan and udp scan.

  TCP Full connect scan: $nmap -sT <server address>
  Stealth scan: $nmap -sS <server address>
  Operating system guess: $nmap -O <server address>
  Xmas scan: $nmap -sX <server address>
  Fin scan: $nmap -sF <server address>
  Null scan: $nmap -sN <server address>
  Ping scan: $nmap -P(S for syn, A for ack, U for UDP, Y for SCTP and E for ICMP echo <server address>

  NOTE: Windows is pretty resistant to Xmas, Fin and Null scan
  NOTE: IP address followed by /24 will scan the last bit with 1 through 256

NIKTO: This tool is used to find vulnerabilities in a server and the syntax is $nikto -host <server address>
