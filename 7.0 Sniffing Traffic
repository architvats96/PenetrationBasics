This module is all about sniffing and analyzing the traffic on a network which could contain some very useful information. 
  The various tools used are macof, wireshark, tshark, driftnet, SMAC, urlsnarf, wwwstat and webspy.

macof: This is a denial tool used to generate bogus traffic in a split second. Don’t try it on your own computer.

Wireshark: Very handy tool to investigate all the incoming and outgoing traffic. Filters are used to filter the traffic and they
  need not be remembered as they can be accessed with the expressions option. This tool provides a shitload of information which
  needs to be taken care of by the tester.

Tshark: This tool is very similar to wireshark and does the job on terminal itself. The protocols can be filtered using grep and
  the entire packet framework can be seen by using tshark in verbose mode.

Driftnet: This tool is used to sniff images and audio on a network but it actually doesn’t works so great.

SMAC: This is a windows tool which is used to change your mac address however it can be done natively in linux. The thing to note
  here is that the networking service must be disabled first and must be enabled after the mac address is changed.

Urlsnarf: This tool just grabs the urls browsed on a network and displays them on a not very easy to read format.

Wwwstat: This tool summarizis WWW server (httpd) access statistics. It is basically used to display a pcap file in a nice format.
  It works great with urlsnarf.

Webspy: This tool gets the url’s from an attacked computer and opens it on the browser of a host computer. This tool could work in
  an infinite loop and this feature of it can be used to perform a DOS attack.
