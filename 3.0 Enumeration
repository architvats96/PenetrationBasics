This is the last module which goes into reconnaissance of a server. It includes default usernames and passwords, the net command 
which include a lot of subcommands, netdiscover and null session

NETDISCOVER: This tool is used to check which ip’s are currently alive on a network and it also finds the MAC addresses concerning 
  the IP address, syntax being $netdiscover -i <network interface>

MACOF: This tool is used to generate traffic on a network.

NULL SESSION: In this technique we make the pc think that we are the administrator and this can be done without username and password.
  This technique works on older microsoft systems and can be performed as follows. Type net use and take a note of the ip address displayed. Then type net use \\<ip address>\IPC$ /u:”” “” Thats it and your privileges have been escalated. This takes use of a flaw in the Inter Process Control module of windows which is beyond my scope now.

This is done a bit differently on linux. To do this on linux we use a tool called smbclient. SYNTAX is 
  $smbclient -I <IP address> -L <hostname> -N -U
