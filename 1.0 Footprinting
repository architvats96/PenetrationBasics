This technique is all about finding information about your target and the tools that we can use for it are nslookup and hping3.

NSLOOKUP: Nslookup is a program to query Internet domain name servers about a target server. It gives two types of answers non 
  authoritative and authoritative. Non autoritative answers are provided by your domain name server and authoritative answers are 
  provided by someone other than you which may be a DNS on internet. Nslookup is used by typing nslookup in terminal and then the 
  name of the server. The various modes that it offers can be set by $set type = <mode name>. The modes are a which is the default 
  mode and gives the ip of server and its canonical name, mx which stands for the mail servers and soa (start of authority) which 
  gives hosting name, mail address.

HPING3: This is used to test whether a server is alive or dead. The point to be noted here is that hping3 sends TCP packets as 
  defaults and this can be changed easily using its manual. The severs usually accepts a specific size of packets and this can be 
  checked with hping3 and the packets can even be fragmented to bypass this and the packets will automatically merge at the server.
