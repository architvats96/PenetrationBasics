# PenetrationBasics
This includes some of the basic concepts of penetration testing on linux

Long before I was introduced to Linux the term penetration testing always intrigued my interests. As I learned Linux using lots of online resources I realized that the internet was forcing me to be a script kiddie when it came to penetration testing. Youtube is full of hacking videos which tell us how to perform a hack but it never tells us the background workings of it. This is my approach to break this barrier by documenting all the required tools concisevely along with some real time hacks.
